            <h2> Content </h2>
            <p>What follows is a list of all the pages that will be implemented in the website. The content of each page will be explained.</p>

            <p> Each page will have a banner along the top of the page where it will be possible to navigate to other pages. </p>
            <ol>
                <li> <h3> The homepage </h3> <!-- Add url extension for the page -->
                    <!-- Mockup picture goes here -->
                    <p> The homepage is the first page the users sees upon entering the website.
                    This page will contain the name "DankMeals" as well as a "meal-of-the-day" box with an image of the meal
                    and an internal link to the recipe for that meal.</p>

                    <p> Since the goal of the website is to get students to do more cooking at home while maintaining a busy schedule,
                    the homepage should not be too cluttered or contain too much content. We opted for a minimalistic and clean homepage
                    to make it as accesible as possible.</p></li>

                <li>
                    <h3> About us </h3> <!-- Add url extension for the page -->
                    <!-- Mockup picture goes here -->
                    <p> The page about us will quite simply be about us, the project and its goals.</p>

                    <p> The backstory of the project as well as its long-term goal, the different people involved and donors will all be included on this page.
                        While the page itself will maintain a simple and clean look, there will be a significant amount of content on this pages
                        compared to the homepage. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3> Contact </h3> <!-- Add url extension for the page -->
                    <!-- Mockup picture goes here -->
                    <p> There will be a form users can fill out with a message in order to contact us.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3> Recipes </h3> <!-- Add url extension for the page -->
                    <!-- Mockup picture goes here -->
                    <p> The page for recipes will contain
                        <ul>
                            <li> links to the three different recipe "repositories", <!-- See below--> </li>
                            <li> a link to a specialized contact form where users will be able to send in suggestions for recipes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p> There will be explanations for what the subpages contain, i.e. what kinds of recipes the user can expect
                        from the three recipe "repositories" and what the suggestions form is used for. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3> Recipe sub-pages </h3> <!-- Add url extensions for each page -->
                    <!-- Mockup picture goes here -->
                    <p> There are three recipe sub-pages, containing recipes for different settings. They are
                        </p>
                    <p> The recipe sub-pages will all have the same structure and design. They will contain a list of all the relevant recipes.
                        Each item in the list will have the name of the meal, an image of the finished meal and a short description.
                        Both the name of the meal and the image will link to the actual recipe. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3> Suggestion form </h3> <!-- Add url extension for the page -->
                    <!-- Mockup picture goes here -->
                    <p> The suggestion form page will be structured quite similarly to the contact page,
                        but will include the fields
                        <ul>
                            <li> Name of the meal. </li>
                            <li> Serving size. </li>
                            <li> Ingredient (1 ingredient per field. Users will be able to add more ingredient fields). </li>
                            <li> Directions. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3> Try your luck </h3> <!-- Add url extension for the page -->
                    <!-- Mockup picture goes here -->
                    <p>
                        The "try-your-luck" page will be centered around one mechanic: generating random meals/drinks by pairing
                        random ingredients together. The users will be able to select either meals or drinks as the subject of the mechanic.
                        The idea of this page is to both encourage the users to experiment more on their own and to humor them with possibly
                        strange meals or drinks.
                    </p>

                    <p> There will be a number of fields (read-only), each of which will contain an ingredient once the meal or drink
                        has been randomly generated. This will be accomplished by simple javascript code and a predefined list of ingredients
                        and a few rules for what cannot be combined.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
