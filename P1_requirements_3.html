                Client name: DankMeals
                Contact info: DankMeals@gmail.com
                    
                Our client is a student organisation called “DankMeals” that wants to promote 
                easy and quick meals for students. The client wants to offer a recipe web-page 
                for student, that makes cooking fun, easy and motivating. The funders of DankMeals
                have experienced themselves how difficult it is to find time to make proper food
                in a busy student life. And that unfortunately results in excessive eating
                of half-fabricates such as frozen pizza, which is both expensive and boring.

            <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
            <p>
                    The purpose of the webpage is to provide easy recipes for students, to 
                    encourage them to make their own meals. Another purpose is to encourage 
                    them to develop their cooking skills, through more advanced recipes.  The
                    goal is for students to be more independent and be able to make a variety 
                    of recipes both for every day, and the weekends. The easy recipes are located
                    at “Hverdag” and the more complicated ones are at the “Kos” section. The 
                    easy recipes can be used to get started with cooking, and the more 
                    complicated can be used to further develop their skills.

            <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>
                The audience will mainly be students of all ages looking to expand on their
                cooking skills. This is a site made for students, by students. Most 
                students have a hectic schedule, low income and tend to take the easy route 
                when it comes to cooking. Therefore, we have gathered cheap and easy-to-make
                recipes for any occasion, whether it is the everyday dinner, pre-drinks or 
                a chill weekend. We market towards students, who tend to be picky with 
                technology. This will pose a challenge in web design as the site has to 
                be bug-free, functional, easy to navigate as well as stylish in order to 
                captivate the short attention span of a student. Ingredients will have to
                be accessible at the local supermarket, and sensible for a student to buy.

                          motivate students to cook more by supplying recipes for meals that are easy to 
                          follow and quick to make.
