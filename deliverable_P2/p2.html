                Our (imaginary) client is an organisation for students by students, that has a current project to promote cooking.
                The client wants a website as part of the project where students can find recipes that are low-budget,
                easy and quick to follow. The members of the project have themselves experienced the difficulty of
                cooking proper meals as a busy student, and hope that the project website will help with the decision
                making of cooking, as well as improve the quality of students' diets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The client is a subgroup of the student organisation, and has taken the name "DankMeals" for the purpose of the project.

            </header>
            <p>
                The purpose of the website is to provide recipes for students that are easy to follow in order to encourage them to make their own meals. Another purpose is to encourage
                them to develop their cooking skills, through more advanced recipes.  The
                goal is for students to be more independent and be able to make a variety
                of meals both for every day and the weekends. The easy recipes are located
                at “Hverdag” and the more complicated ones are at the “Kos” section. The
                easy recipes can be used to get started with cooking, and the more
                complicated can be used to further develop their skills.

                <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                The navigation for the site indicates how we want the pages to link together,
                as shown in the figure below. As described earlier, the site has to let the
                users navigate easily through the different pages, and find recipes with at most
                three clicks, regardless of where they are on the site. In the storyboard, the pink
                here represents the elements which are always accessible from the navigation bar at
                the top of the page. More detailed descriptions regarding design and content here
                are specified in the Contents section.
            </p>
            <img src="img/mockups/file_hierarchy.png" alt="Navigation Structure" width = 600px>
            <p>
                Since the purpose of the website is to provide recipes, the structure should
                reflect this, and the recipes and the try-your-luck-functions are thus intentionally
                placed first, steering visitors to what we want most accessible, with further content
                available through a drop-down menu. Given that, our website has a hierarchical structure,
                a structure characterized by visitors starting on a home page, where they click through
                from a general page to more specific sites. Precisely due to the linking to subtopic menus,
                most users find this way of organizing information easy to understand and intuitive to
                navigate in.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even though the site-organization has a tree-like structure, does not mean that visitors
                have to back-track to jump from one section of the page to another. This is due to
                the navigation bar at the top which is always visible (and also through the search bar),
                allowing for easy movement between the different content areas. Further, this type of structure,
                which works best with well-organized material, ensures that we have to be intentional in choosing
                our content, providing a framework for always keeping in mind the purpose of our site;
                Serving students an easy access to learn to cook for themselves.

            <p>What follows is a list of all the pages that will be implemented in the website. The content of each page will be explained.</p>

            <p> Each page will have a banner along the top of the page where it will be possible to navigate to other pages. </p>

                    <img src = "img/mockups/navbar_dropdown.png" alt="Homepage" width=540px>
                    <p> The homepage is the first page the users sees upon entering the website.
                    This page will contain the name "DankMeals" as well as a "meal-of-the-day" box with an image of the meal
                    and an internal link to the recipe for that meal.</p>

                    <p> Since the goal of the website is to get students to do more cooking at home while maintaining a busy schedule,
                    the homepage should not be too cluttered or contain too much content. We opted for a minimalistic and clean homepage
                    to make it as accesible as possible.</p></li>

                <li>
                    <h3> About us </h3> <!-- Add url extension for the page -->
                    <img src = "img/mockups/about.png" alt = "About us page" width = 540px>
                    <p> The page about us will quite simply be about us, the project and its goals.</p>

                    <p> The backstory of the project as well as its long-term goal, the different people involved and donors will all be included on this page.
                        While the page itself will maintain a simple and clean look, there will be a significant amount of content on this pages
                        compared to the homepage. </p>

                <li>
                    <h3> Recipes </h3> <!-- Add url extension for the page -->
                    <!-- Mockup picture goes here -->
                    <p> The page for recipes will contain
                        <ul>
                            <li> links to the three different recipe "repositories", <!-- See below--> </li>

                    </p>

                    <p> There will be explanations for what the subpages contain, i.e. what kinds of recipes the user can expect
                        from the three recipe "repositories" and what the suggestions form is used for. </p>
                </li>

                    <p> There are three recipe sub-pages, containing recipes for different settings. They are
                        </p>
                    <p> The recipe sub-pages will all have the same structure and design. They will contain a list of all the relevant recipes.
                        Each item in the list will have the name of the meal, an image of the finished meal and a short description.
                        Both the name of the meal and the image will link to the actual recipe. </p>
                </li>

                    <p> The suggestion form page will be structured quite similarly to the contact page,
                        but will include the fields
                        <ul>
                            <li> Name of the meal. </li>
                            <li> Serving size. </li>
                            <li> Ingredient (1 ingredient per field. Users will be able to add more ingredient fields). </li>
                            <li> Instructions. </li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>
                        The "try-your-luck" page will be centered around one mechanic: generating random meals/drinks by pairing
                        random ingredients together. The users will be able to select either meals or drinks as the subject of the mechanic.
                        The idea of this page is to both encourage the users to experiment more on their own and to humor them with possibly
                        strange meals or drinks.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/mockups/try_your_luck2.png" alt="Try your luck result after generation" width = 540px>
                    <p>
                        There will be a number of fields (read-only), each of which will contain an ingredient once the meal or drink
                        has been randomly generated. This will be accomplished by simple javascript code and a predefined list of ingredients
                        and a few rules for what cannot be combined.

                The minimum requirements is fulfilled by having four distinct
                 JavaScript applications, one in the page:
                <ol>
                    <li>In the try-your-luck section, the dish page, an array storing all the possible
                         ingredients, within 3 categories (protein, sauce, vegtable) will randomly
                          get one ingredient from each category and present it to the user on the
                          web-page (when clicking a button). The same for drinks page, but here with
                           2 categories (type of liquor and bevegage to mix it with). These will be
                           split into two js files, but have almost the same functionality. Emil is
                           in charge of this section.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Also in the try-your-luck section, both pages with show a visualization of going
                        though all the ingredients in the arrays storing meals (in random order), which
                        slows down with time. Then it will finally show the ingredient, which uses the
                         functionallity in 1. Johan is in charge of this section.

                    <li>
                        When inside a recipe, a user can change the amount of people the recipe
                        is for, by using a textfield form element. This will then calculate the
                        amount of the ingredients needed for the adjusted portions. This will
                        be done by looping though the elements and e.g. multiplying each
                        ingredient by two if the portion size doubles. Gry and Ane is in
                        charge of this section.

                    <li>
                        When inside a recipe, the user will be presented with a drink
                        (and a link to where the recipe for this drink is, unless it can be
                        purchased ready to drink), which is randomly generated from an array
                        with drinks that fit that type of meat (e.g. a type of cheap red
                        wine with steak). Solfrid is in charge of this section.

                        also extend to meals of the week. Should not repeat the same meal,
                        until all has been looped though.
