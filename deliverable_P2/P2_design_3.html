                Our (imaginary) client is an organisation for students by students, that has a current project to promote cooking.
                The client wants a website as part of the project where students can find recipes that are low-budget,
                easy and quick to follow. The members of the project have themselves experienced the difficulty of
                cooking proper meals as a busy student, and hope that the project website will help with the decision
                making of cooking, as well as improve the quality of students' diets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The client is a subgroup of the student organisation, and has taken the name "DankMeals" for the purpose of the project.

            </header>
            <p>
                The purpose of the website is to provide recipes for students that are easy to follow in order to encourage them to make their own meals. Another purpose is to encourage
                them to develop their cooking skills, through more advanced recipes.  The
                goal is for students to be more independent and be able to make a variety
                of meals both for every day and the weekends. The easy recipes are located
                at “Hverdag” and the more complicated ones are at the “Kos” section. The
                easy recipes can be used to get started with cooking, and the more
                complicated can be used to further develop their skills.

                <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                The navigation for the site indicates how we want the pages to link together,
                as shown in the figure below. As described earlier, the site has to let the
                users navigate easily through the different pages, and find recipes with at most
                three clicks, regardless of where they are on the site. In the storyboard, the pink
                here represents the elements which are always accessible from the navigation bar at
                the top of the page. More detailed descriptions regarding design and content here
                are specified in the Contents section.
            </p>
            <img src="img/mockups/file_hierarchy.png" alt="Navigation Structure" width = 600px>
            <p>
                Since the purpose of the website is to provide recipes, the structure should
                reflect this, and the recipes and the try-your-luck-functions are thus intentionally
                placed first, steering visitors to what we want most accessible, with further content
                available through a drop-down menu. Given that, our website has a hierarchical structure,
                a structure characterized by visitors starting on a home page, where they click through
                from a general page to more specific sites. Precisely due to the linking to subtopic menus,
                most users find this way of organizing information easy to understand and intuitive to
                navigate in.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even though the site-organization has a tree-like structure, does not mean that visitors
                have to back-track to jump from one section of the page to another. This is due to
                the navigation bar at the top which is always visible (and also through the search bar),
                allowing for easy movement between the different content areas. Further, this type of structure,
                which works best with well-organized material, ensures that we have to be intentional in choosing
                our content, providing a framework for always keeping in mind the purpose of our site;
                Serving students an easy access to learn to cook for themselves.

                <h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
            </header>
            <p> We wanted to keep the universal design simple yet stylish. The color scheme 
                is a neutral blue, grey and white with some shade variations. The font of 
                the entire page is Rubik, which is easy to read and looks good. The site
                should be easy to navigate, therefore we included a header with each section
                of the site on the navigation bar. Hovering over a tab on the navbar will 
                change the color to a darker shade so the user will immidiately understand
                which subpage they navigate to before clicking. The recipe section will 
                be a dropdown menu with the highlighted subpage will change to an even 
                darker shade than on the navbar. The try-your-luck button will be a big 
                red button which encourages anyone to click it out of excitement.
                These design choices are made to make the website look nice and make
                it recognizable and easy to navigate.The mockups provided in later sections
                showcase all these stylistic elements. A mockup of the navigation bar is shown in Figure 1.

            </header>
            <p>What follows is a list of all the pages that will be implemented in the website. The content of each page will be explained.</p>

            <p> Each page will have a banner along the top of the page where it will be possible to navigate to other pages. </p>
            <ol>
                <li> <h3> The homepage </h3> <!-- Add url extension for the page -->
                
                    <p> The homepage is the first page the users sees upon entering the website.
                        This page will contain a "Meal of the Day" with an image of the meal, 
                        and an internal link to the recipe for that meal. A mockup of the page is shown in Figure 2. 
                        The size of the image is 475x300px, and has a margin of 18px from the body.
                        The name of the meal is a clickable link, which leads to the recipe. The recipe changes
                        every day, where the possible recipes are the ones that exist on the web-page. They are looped
                        through, so that they will repeat after all have been shown.
                    </p>

                    <p> Since the goal of the website is to get students to do more cooking at 
                        home while maintaining a busy schedule,
                        the homepage should not be too cluttered or contain too much content.
                        We opted for a minimalistic and clean homepage
                        to make it as accessible as possible. </p>

                        people involved and donors will all be included on this page.
                        While the page itself will maintain a simple and clean look, there
                        will be a significant amount of content on this pages

                        A mockup of this page is shown in Figure 6. Below the links to the "repositories" are images showing
                        examples from related food. These images (which there are three of), are 200x200px. The links plus images
                        will be places on the page such that they have equal amount of empty space between them.

                            height of the box fits the text of the ingredients. The width is 250px.
                            The other part of the page is shifted to the right. An image of the finished meal will
                            be 500px wide (the height can depend on the image's ratio). A mockup of this is shown in Figure 6.
                            Inside the white box containing the ingredients, there will also be a text field where the user can enter
                            how many persons the recipe should be for (4 is default).

                    <p> The recipe sub-pages (which there are three of) will all have the same structure and design. They will contain a list of all the relevant recipes, with 
                        three recipe links on each row.
                        Each item in the list will have the name of the meal, and image of the finished meal. 
                        The entire box, which contains the name and image, will be a link to the recipe. 
                        A mockup of this is shown in Figure 7. </p>

                    <p>Each box will have a height of 200px and a width of 170px. The font size 
                        of the name of the recipe will be 14pt. The images of the recipes within the box will be 160x100px (to make room for
                        the name of the recipe). The border color, as well as the font color, of the box that is hoved over will change from 
                        black to blue (#9FBACE), as shown in Figure 7 (for the recipe in the middle, top row) .

                    <p> The suggestion form page will be structured quite similarly to the contact page,
                        but will also include the text fields name of the meal, serving size, ingredient and instructions. The user 
                        can only fill one ingredient per field, but can add additional fields by pressing a button if needed. 
                        Also here the user will have to have entered text to be able to submitt. 
                        A mockup is shown in Figure 8. When the user submitts, an alert will appear saying "Submission recieved".

                    <h3> Try-your-luck </h3> <!-- Add url extension for the page -->
                
                    <p>
                        The "try-your-luck" page will be centered around one mechanic: generating random meals/drinks by pairing
                        random ingredients together. The users will be able to select either meals or drinks as the subject of the mechanic.
                        The idea of this page is to both encourage the users to experiment more on their own and to humor them with possibly
                        strange meals or drinks.
                    </p>
                    <p>The red big button is supposed to be centre of attention at this site and should therefore occupy some space. 
                        The height and width of the button will be set to 350px each, with 20px margins and paddings. A mockup of this is shown in
                        Figure 9. If meal is selected as the type to generate for, the box surrounding it has a color of #A4A3A3, while if it 
                        is not selected it has a color of #D9D9D9.
                        When hovered the padding of the button should change colour from the color of the background to 
                        grey (for a shadow-like effect), and when pushed the user will hear a short sound. </p>

                        There will be text fields (read-only), each of which will contain an ingredient once the meal or drink
                        has been randomly generated. For the generating meal there will be three text fields, and  
                        for generating drinks there will be two text fiels.
                        This will be accomplished by simple javascript code and a predefined list of ingredients
                        and a few rules for what cannot be combined.  A mockup of the page after pressing the button is shown in Figure 10.

                The minimum requirements is fulfilled by having four distinct

                         ingredients, within 3 categories (protein, sauce, vegtable) will randomly
                          get one ingredient from each category and present it to the user on the
                          web-page (when clicking a button). The same for drinks page, but here with
                           2 categories (type of liquor and bevegage to mix it with). These will be
                           split into two js files, but have almost the same functionality. Emil is
                           in charge of this section.

                    <li>
                        Also in the try-your-luck section, both pages with show a visualization of going
                        though all the ingredients in the arrays storing meals (in random order), which
                        slows down with time. Then it will finally show the ingredient, which uses the
                         functionallity in 1. Johan is in charge of this section.

                        When inside a recipe, a user can change the amount of people the recipe
                        is for, by using a textfield form element. This will then calculate the
                        amount of the ingredients needed for the adjusted portions. This will
                        be done by looping though the elements and e.g. multiplying each
                        ingredient by two if the portion size doubles. Gry and Ane is in
                        charge of this section.

                        until all has been looped though.
